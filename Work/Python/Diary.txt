Cloned repository from Bitbucket to Asus laptop
Updated to do.txt
Installed Jypyter, osqp, cobrapy
Created Jupyter notebook "notebook" in Python directory
ran cobrapy test_all test suite. 85 passed, 4 skipped, 9 failed, 14 warnings in 29.83 seconds.
30.06.19:
Constrainfluxes.py couldn't run due to calling outdated SBML import function name "create_cobra_model_from_sbml_file ". Managed to run constrainfluxes.py script after updating function name for SBML import function.
Many warnings from cobrapy that "Encoding OBJECTIVE_COEFFICIENT in KineticLaw is discouraged."
Updated readme.md. Initially unable to get image embedding with relative path working on bitbucket.
loadData.py appears to be working OK.
Updated flowchart.
Reviewed optreqanalysis.py and qpmindisty.py. Lacking a gurobi license, these must be updated to use a different solver (osqp?) before they can be tested.
Executed cobylaminimal2.py with no errors.
Attempted to run cobrapytest.py which resulted in error:
"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\jarlemag\metabolic-network-analysis\Work\Python\cobrapytest.py", line 24, in <module>
    SCHUETZR.optimize(solver='gurobi')
TypeError: optimize() got an unexpected keyword argument 'solver'"
Studied the source code for cobra.model.optimize and cobra.core.solution in order to understand solver selection in current version of cobrapy. 
Don't understand exactly when/where OPTLANG/the selected optimizer is called, but it appears like GLPK may be the default solver? Update: the following code in cobra.util.solver.py sets the default solver preference for linear optimization: "lp_order = ["glpk", "cplex", "gurobi"]"
Executed the following code without errors:
>>> import cobra.test
>>> model = cobra.test.create_test_model("textbook")
>>> model.optimize()
See also cobra.util.solver. ...
Removed non-useable code from end of cobrapytest.py (optimization of model "iJE660a_fromMPS.sbml". The model is not in the repository. See "MPStocobramodel.py" for code which was probably used to generate this SBML file. The source of the MPS file is unclear.
Updated cobrapytest.py to work with new cobrapy syntax/object structure. (unable to generate solution for ECME model. (Infeasible.))
Installed scitools3. Attempted to execute CalculabilityAnalysis.py. Error on line 145, appears to be related to comment about having to find correct slice (index) for the array. Thus probably not related to changes in dependent libraries or python2 -> python 3.
Tested convertrxmaps.py. Appears to work OK.
Test createReactionmap.py. Appears to work OK.
Attempted to fix/update syntax in FluxCoupling.py. At least 1 syntax error ream
Updated fluxreport.py. Appears to work partially. Removed reference to extractflux2.py from extractflux.py header. Appears to work OK.
Updated cobrapy and Python 3 syntax in gx-FBA.py. Unable to test this script, as it imports qpmindist, which uses gurobi.
Updated print syntax in lambdacheck.py. Appears to work OK.
