  title = {{FASIMU}: flexible software for flux-balance computation series in
	large metabolic networks.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {12},
  number = {28},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Flux-balance analysis based on linear optimization is
	widely used to compute metabolic fluxes in large metabolic networks
	and gains increasingly importance in network curation and structural
	analysis. Thus, a computational tool flexible enough to realize a
	wide variety of FBA algorithms and able to handle batch series of
	flux-balance optimizations is of great benefit. RESULTS: We present
	FASIMU, a command line oriented software for the computation of flux
	distributions using a variety of the most common FBA algorithms,
	including the first available implementation of (i) weighted flux
	minimization, (ii) fitness maximization for partially inhibited enzymes,
	and (iii) of the concentration-based thermodynamic feasibility constraint.
	It allows batch computation with varying objectives and constraints
	suited for network pruning, leak analysis, flux-variability analysis,
	and systematic probing of metabolic objectives for network curation.
	Input and output supports SBML. FASIMU can work with free (lp_solve
	and GLPK) or commercial solvers (CPLEX, LINDO). A new plugin (faBiNA)
	for BiNA allows to conveniently visualize calculated flux distributions.
	The platform-independent program is an open-source project, freely
	available under GNU public license at http://www.bioinformatics.org/fasimu
	including manual, tutorial, and plugins. CONCLUSIONS: We present
	a flux-balance optimization program whose main merits are the implementation
	of thermodynamics as a constraint, batch series of computations,
	free availability of sources, choice on various external solvers,
	and the flexibility on metabolic objectives and constraints.},

  abstract = {Background
	
	
	Cellular metabolism is one of the most investigated system of biological
	interactions. While the topological nature of individual reactions
	and pathways in the network is quite well understood there is still
	a lack of comprehension regarding the global functional behavior
	of the system. In the last few years flux-balance analysis (FBA)
	has been the most successful and widely used technique for studying
	metabolism at system level. This method strongly relies on the hypothesis
	that the organism maximizes an objective function. However only under
	very specific biological conditions (e.g. maximization of biomass
	for E. coli in reach nutrient medium) the cell seems to obey such
	optimization law. A more refined analysis not assuming extremization
	remains an elusive task for large metabolic systems due to algorithmic
	limitations.
	
	Results
	
	
	In this work we propose a novel algorithmic strategy that provides
	an efficient characterization of the whole set of stable fluxes compatible
	with the metabolic constraints. Using a technique derived from the
	fields of statistical physics and information theory we designed
	a message-passing algorithm to estimate the size of the affine space
	containing all possible steady-state flux distributions of metabolic
	networks. The algorithm, based on the well known Bethe approximation,
	can be used to approximately compute the volume of a non full-dimensional
	convex polytope in high dimensions. We first compare the accuracy
	of the predictions with an exact algorithm on small random metabolic
	networks. We also verify that the predictions of the algorithm match
	closely those of Monte Carlo based methods in the case of the Red
	Blood Cell metabolic network. Then we test the effect of gene knock-outs
	on the size of the solution space in the case of E. coli central
	metabolism. Finally we analyze the statistical properties of the
	average fluxes of the reactions in the E. coli metabolic network.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the Flux Coupling Finder (FCF) framework
	for elucidating the topological and flux connectivity features of
	genome-scale metabolic networks. The framework is demonstrated on
	genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of Helicobacter pylori, {E}scherichia
	coli, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The analysis allows one to determine
	whether any two metabolic fluxes, v(1) and v(2), are (1) directionally
	coupled, if a non-zero flux for v(1) implies a non-zero flux for
	v(2) but not necessarily the reverse; (2) partially coupled, if a
	non-zero flux for v(1) implies a non-zero, though variable, flux
	for v(2) and vice versa; or (3) fully coupled, if a non-zero flux
	for v(1) implies not only a non-zero but also a fixed flux for v(2)
	and vice versa. Flux coupling analysis also enables the global identification
	of blocked reactions, which are all reactions incapable of carrying
	flux under a certain condition; equivalent knockouts, defined as
	the set of all possible reactions whose deletion forces the flux
	through a particular reaction to zero; and sets of affected reactions
	denoting all reactions whose fluxes are forced to zero if a particular
	reaction is deleted. The FCF approach thus provides a novel and versatile
	tool for aiding metabolic reconstructions and guiding genetic manipulations.},

	described using different representation. Flux-balance analysis (FBA)
	has been useful for large-scale analysis of metabolic networks, and
	methods have been developed to incorporate transcriptional regulation
	(regulatory FBA, or rFBA). Of current interest is the integration
	of these approaches with detailed models based on ordinary differential
	equations (ODEs).Results: We developed an approach to modeling the
	dynamic behavior of metabolic, regulatory and signaling networks
	by combining FBA with regulatory Boolean logic, and ordinary differential
	equations. We use this approach (called integrated FBA, or iFBA)
	to create an integrated model of \textit{Escherichia coli} which
	combines a flux-balance-based, central carbon metabolic and transcriptional
	regulatory model with an ODE-based, detailed model of carbohydrate
	uptake control. We compare the predicted \textit{Escherichia coli}
	wild-type and single gene perturbation phenotypes for diauxic growth
	on glucose/lactose and glucose/glucose-6-phosphate with that of the
	individual models. We find that iFBA encapsulates the dynamics of
	three internal metabolites and three transporters inadequately predicted
	by rFBA. Furthermore, we find that iFBA predicts different and more
	accurate phenotypes than the ODE model for 85 of 334 single gene
	perturbation simulations, as well for the wild-type simulations.
	We conclude that iFBA is a significant improvement over the individual
	rFBA and ODE modeling paradigms.Availability: All MATLAB files used

	protocols, the tool also implements the analysis of minimal substrate
	and product sets, which is useful for metabolic engineering and prediction
	of nutritional requirements in complex in vivo environments, but
	not available in other commonly used programs. The SurreyFBA is based
	on a command line interface to the GLPK solver distributed as binary
	and source code for the three major operating systems. The command
	line tool, implemented in C++, is easily executed within scripting
	languages used in the bioinformatics community and provides efficient
	implementation of tasks requiring iterative calls to the linear programming
	solver. SurreyFBA includes JyMet, a graphics user interface allowing
	spreadsheet-based model presentation, visualization of numerical
	results on metabolic networks represented in the Petri net convention,
	as well as in charts and plots.Availability: SurreyFBA is distributed

  abstract = {MOTIVATION:
	
	
	Metabolic modelling provides a mathematically rigorous basis for system-level
	analysis of biochemical networks. However, the growing sizes of metabolic
	models can lead to serious problems in their construction and validation.
	In this work, we describe a relatively poorly investigated type of
	modelling error, called stoichiometric inconsistencies. These errors
	are caused by incorrect definitions of reaction stoichiometries and
	result in conflicts between two fundamental physical constraints
	to be satisfied by any valid metabolic model: positivity of molecular
	masses of all metabolites and mass conservation in all interconversions.
	
	RESULTS:
	
	
	We introduce formal definitions of stoichiometric inconsistencies,
	inconsistent net stoichiometries, elementary leakage modes and other
	important fundamental properties of incorrectly defined biomolecular
	networks. Algorithms are described for the verification of stoichiometric
	consistency of a model, detection of unconserved metabolites and
	inconsistent minimal net stoichiometries. The usefulness of these
	algorithms for effective resolving of inconsistencies and for detection
	of input errors is demonstrated on a published genome-scale metabolic
	model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and one of Streptococcus agalactiae
	constructed using the KEGG database.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Microalgae have the potential to deliver biofuels without
	the associated competition for land resources. In order to realise
	the rates and titres necessary for commercial production, however,
	system-level metabolic engineering will be required. Genome scale
	metabolic reconstructions have revolutionized microbial metabolic
	engineering and are used routinely for in silico analysis and design.
	While genome scale metabolic reconstructions have been developed
	for many prokaryotes and model eukaryotes, the application to less
	well characterized eukaryotes such as algae is challenging not at
	least due to a lack of compartmentalization data.RESULTS:We have
	developed a genome-scale metabolic network model (named AlgaGEM)
	covering the metabolism for a compartmentalized algae cell based
	on the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome. AlgaGEM is a comprehensive
	literature-based genome scale metabolic reconstruction that accounts
	for the functions of 866 unique ORFs, 1862 metabolites, 2249 gene-enzyme-reaction-association
	entries, and 1725 unique reactions. The reconstruction was compartmentalized
	into the cytoplasm, mitochondrion, plastid and microbody using available
	data for algae complemented with compartmentalisation data for Arabidopsis
	thaliana. AlgaGEM describes a functional primary metabolism of Chlamydomonas
	and significantly predicts distinct algal behaviours such as the
	catabolism or secretion rather than recycling of phosphoglycolate
	in photorespiration. AlgaGEM was validated through the simulation
	of growth and algae metabolic functions inferred from literature.
	Using efficient resource utilisation as the optimality criterion,
	AlgaGEM predicted observed metabolic effects under autotrophic, heterotrophic
	and mixotrophic conditions. AlgaGEM predicts increased hydrogen production
	when cyclic electron flow is disrupted as seen in a high producing
	mutant derived from mutational studies. The model also predicted
	the physiological pathway for H2 production and identified new targets
	to further improve H2 yield.CONCLUSIONS:AlgaGEM is a viable and comprehensive
	framework for in silico functional analysis and can be used to derive
	new, non-trivial hypotheses for exploring this metabolically versatile
	organism. Flux balance analysis can be used to identify bottlenecks
	and new targets to metabolically engineer microalgae for production
	of biofuels.},

  abstract = {Elementary modes represent a valuable concept in the analysis of metabolic
	reaction networks. However, they can only be computed in medium-size
	systems, preventing application to genome-scale metabolic models.
	In consequence, the analysis is usually constrained to a specific
	part of the known metabolism, and the remaining system is modeled
	using abstractions like exchange fluxes and external species. As
	we show by the analysis of a model of the central metabolism of {E}scherichia
	coli that has been previously analyzed using elementary modes, the
	choice of these abstractions heavily impacts the pathways that are
	detected, and the results are biased by the knowledge of the metabolic
	capabilities of the network by the user. In order to circumvent these
	problems, we introduce the concept of elementary flux patterns, which
	explicitly takes into account possible steady-state fluxes through
	a genome-scale metabolic network when analyzing pathways through
	a subsystem. By being similar to elementary mode analysis, our concept
	now allows for the application of many elementary-mode-based tools
	to genome-scale metabolic networks. We present an algorithm to compute
	elementary flux patterns and analyze a model of the tricarboxylic
	acid cycle and adjacent reactions in {E}. coli. Thus, we detect several
	pathways that can be used as alternative routes to some central metabolic
	pathways. Finally, we give an outlook on further applications like
	the computation of minimal media, the development of knockout strategies,
	and the analysis of combined genome-scale networks.},

  abstract = {The metabolism of organisms can be studied with comprehensive stoichiometric
	models of their metabolic networks. Flux balance analysis (FBA) calculates
	optimal metabolic performance of stoichiometric models. However,
	detailed biological interpretation of FBA is limited because, in
	general, a huge number of flux patterns give rise to the same optimal
	performance. The complete description of the resulting optimal solution
	spaces was thus far a computationally intractable problem. Here we
	present CoPE-FBA: Comprehensive Polyhedra Enumeration Flux Balance
	Analysis, a computational method that solves this problem. CoPE-FBA
	indicates that the thousands to millions of optimal flux patterns
	result from a combinatorial explosion of flux patterns in just a
	few metabolic sub-networks. The entire optimal solution space can
	now be compactly described in terms of the topology of these sub-networks.
	CoPE-FBA simplifies the biological interpretation of stoichiometric
	models of metabolism, and provides a profound understanding of metabolic
	flexibility in optimal states.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Mathematical modelling of cellular networks is an integral
	part of Systems Biology and requires appropriate software tools.
	An important class of methods in Systems Biology deals with structural
	or topological (parameter-free) analysis of cellular networks. So
	far, software tools providing such methods for both mass-flow (metabolic)
	as well as signal-flow (signalling and regulatory) networks are lacking.RESULTS:Herein
	we introduce CellNetAnalyzer, a toolbox for MATLAB facilitating,
	in an interactive and visual manner, a comprehensive structural analysis
	of metabolic, signalling and regulatory networks. The particular
	strengths of CellNetAnalyzer are methods for functional network analysis,
	i.e. for characterising functional states, for detecting functional
	dependencies, for identifying intervention strategies, or for giving
	qualitative predictions on the effects of perturbations. CellNetAnalyzer
	extends its predecessor FluxAnalyzer (originally developed for metabolic
	network and pathway analysis) by a new modelling framework for examining
	signal-flow networks. Two of the novel methods implemented in CellNetAnalyzer
	are discussed in more detail regarding algorithmic issues and applications:
	the computation and analysis (i) of shortest positive and shortest
	negative paths and circuits in interaction graphs and (ii) of minimal
	intervention sets in logical networks.CONCLUSION:CellNetAnalyzer
	provides a single suite to perform structural and qualitative analysis
	of both mass-flow- and signal-flow-based cellular networks in a user-friendly
	environment. It provides a large toolbox with various, partially
	unique, functions and algorithms for functional network analysis.CellNetAnalyzer

	enable the estimation of fluxes at a high resolution. In this paper,
	we present data validating the use of mass spectrometry (MS) for
	the quantification of complex metabolic flux networks. In the context
	of the lysine biosynthesis flux network of Corynebacterium glutamicum
	(ATCC 21799) under glucose limitation in continuous culture, operating
	at 0.1Â·hâˆ’1Â after the introduction of 50% [1-13C]glucose, we deploy
	a bioreaction network analysis methodology for flux determination
	from mass isotopomer measurements of biomass hydrolysates, while
	thoroughly addressing the issues of measurement accuracy, flux observability
	and data reconciliation. The analysis enabled the resolution of the
	involved anaplerotic activity of the microorganism using only one
	labeled substrate, the determination of the range of most of the
	exchange fluxes and the validation of the flux estimates through
	satisfaction of redundancies. Specifically, we determined that phosphoenolpyruvate
	carboxykinase and synthase do not carry flux at these experimental
	conditions and identified a high futile cycle between oxaloacetate
	and pyruvate, indicating a highly active inÂ vivo oxaloacetate decarboxylase.
	Both results validated previous in vitro activity measurements. The

	a very important result considering that prior flux analyses of extensive

  abstract = {Motivation: Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a well-known technique
	for genome-scale modeling of metabolic flux. Typically, an FBA formulation
	requires the accurate specification of four sets: biochemical reactions,
	biomass metabolites, nutrients and secreted metabolites. The development
	of FBA models can be time consuming and tedious because of the difficulty
	in assembling completely accurate descriptions of these sets, and
	in identifying errors in the composition of these sets. For example,
	the presence of a single non-producible metabolite in the biomass
	will make the entire model infeasible. Other difficulties in FBA
	modeling are that model distributions, and predicted fluxes, can
	be cryptic and difficult to understand.Results: We present a multiple
	gap-filling method to accelerate the development of FBA models using
	a new tool, called MetaFlux, based on mixed integer linear programming
	(MILP). The method suggests corrections to the sets of reactions,
	biomass metabolites, nutrients and secretions. The method generates
	FBA models directly from Pathway/Genome Databases. Thus, FBA models
	developed in this framework are easily queried and visualized using
	the Pathway Tools software. Predicted fluxes are more easily comprehended
	by visualizing them on diagrams of individual metabolic pathways
	or of metabolic maps. MetaFlux can also remove redundant high-flux
	loops, solve FBA models once they are generated and model the effects
	of gene knockouts. MetaFlux has been validated through construction
	of FBA models for \textit{Escherichia coli} and Homo sapiens.Availability:

	a new method for dynamic metabolic flux analysis (DMFA) of systems

	method are: (1) time-series of metabolite concentration data can
	be applied directly for estimating dynamic fluxes, making data smoothing
	and estimation of average extracellular rates unnecessary; (2) flux
	estimation is achieved without integration of ODEs, or iterations;
	(3) characteristic metabolic phases in the fermentation data are
	identified automatically by the algorithm, rather than selected manually/arbitrarily.
	We demonstrate the application of the new DMFA framework in three
	example systems. First, we evaluated the performance of DMFA in a
	simple three-reaction model in terms of accuracy, precision and flux
	observability. Next, we analyzed a commercial glucose-limited fed-batch
	process for 1,3-propanediol production. The DMFA method accurately
	captured the dynamic behavior of the fed-batch fermentation and identified
	characteristic metabolic phases. Lastly, we demonstrate that DMFA
	can be used without any assumed metabolic network model for data

  abstract = {Genome-scale constraint-based models of several organisms have now
	been constructed and are being used for model driven research. A
	key issue that may arise in the use of such models is the existence
	of alternate optimal solutions wherein the same maximal objective
	(e.g., growth rate) can be achieved through different flux distributions.
	Herein, we investigate the effects that alternate optimal solutions
	may have on the predicted range of flux values calculated using currently
	practiced linear (LP) and quadratic programming (QP) methods. An
	efficient LP-based strategy is described to calculate the range of
	flux variability that can be present in order to achieve optimal
	as well as suboptimal objective states. Sample results are provided
	for growth predictions of E. coli using glucose, acetate, and lactate
	as carbon substrates. These results demonstrate the extent of flux
	variability to be highly dependent on environmental conditions and
	network composition. In addition we examined the impact of alternate
	optima for growth under gene knockout conditions as calculated using
	QP-based methods. It was observed that calculations using QP-based
	methods can show significant variation in growth rate if the flux
	variability among alternate optima is high. The underlying biological
	significance and general source of such flux variability is further
	investigated through the identification of redundancies in the network
	(equivalent reaction sets) that lead to alternate solutions. Collectively,
	these results illustrate the variability inherent in metabolic flux
	distributions and the possible implications of this heterogeneity
	for constraint-based modeling approaches. These methods also provide
	an efficient and robust method to calculate the range of flux distributions
	that can be derived from quantitative fermentation data.},

	However, the intrinsic robustness of the pathway might still conceal

	experimental growth indicated that unreported reactions existed within

	assays. Novel reactions regarding the breakdown of sedoheptulose-7-phosphate
	to erythrose-4-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate were observed
	in transaldolase-deficient mutants, without any noticeable changes

	glycolytic enzymes ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase and aldolase.
	The emergence of an alternative pathway not requiring any changes

	To confirm whether PfkA and FbaA can directly convert S7P to E4P and
	DHAP, we purified recombinant PfkA and FbaA proteins and examined
	their activities in vitro. When S7P and ATP were incubated with PfkA,
	S7P and ATP were consumed in equivalent proportions, and a metabolite
	with an m/z ratio of 369.0 was produced (Table III). This metabolite
	co-migrated with the suspected S1,7P observed by metabolite profiling
	of talAB-knockout cells. Moreover, addition of FbaA to the reaction
	resulted in the production of E4P and DHAP, apparently from the metabolite
	(m/z 369.0). These results provide direct evidence that PfkA and
	FbaA have the capacity to catalyze a previously unreported transformation

	with increasing network distance, a naÃ¯ve, but widely used, topological
	index. Others have suggested that static graph representations can
	poorly capture dynamic functional associations, e.g., in the form
	of dependence of metabolic fluxes across genes in the network. Here,

	coupling and network position on gene co-regulation, using a genome-scale

	validating the computational method with empirical data on flux correlations,

	show similar expression patterns, but also share transcriptional
	regulators and frequently reside in the same operon. In contrast,
	we demonstrate that network distance per se has relatively minor
	influence on gene co-regulation. Moreover, the type of flux coupling
	can explain refined properties of the regulatory network that are
	ignored by simple graph-theoretical indices. Our results underline

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The iJO1366 reconstruction of the metabolic network of
	\texti{\textit{Escherichia coli}} is one of the most complete and
	accurate metabolic reconstructions available for any organism. Still,
	because our knowledge of even well-studied model organisms such as
	this one is incomplete, this network reconstruction contains gaps
	and possible errors. There are a total of 208 blocked metabolites
	in iJO1366, representing gaps in the network. RESULTS: A new model
	improvement workflow was developed to compare model based phenotypic
	predictions to experimental data to fill gaps and correct errors.
	A Keio Collection based dataset of E. coli gene essentiality was
	obtained from literature data and compared to model predictions.
	The SMILEY algorithm was then used to predict the most likely missing
	reactions in the reconstructed network, adding reactions from a KEGG
	based universal set of metabolic reactions. The feasibility of these
	putative reactions was determined by comparing updated versions of
	the model to the experimental dataset, and genes were predicted for
	the most feasible reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous improvements to
	the iJO1366 metabolic reconstruction were suggested by these analyses.
	Experiments were performed to verify several computational predictions,
	including a new mechanism for growth on myo-inositol. The other predictions
	made in this study should be experimentally verifiable by similar
	means. Validating all of the predictions made here represents a substantial
	but important undertaking.},

  pages = {308},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Through genetic engineering it is possible to introduce
	targeted genetic changes and hereby engineer the metabolism of microbial
	cells with the objective to obtain desirable phenotypes. However,
	owing to the complexity of metabolic networks, both in terms of structure
	and regulation, it is often difficult to predict the effects of genetic
	modifications on the resulting phenotype. Recently genome-scale metabolic
	models have been compiled for several different microorganisms where
	structural and stoichiometric complexity is inherently accounted
	for. New algorithms are being developed by using genome-scale metabolic
	models that enable identification of gene knockout strategies for
	obtaining improved phenotypes. However, the problem of finding optimal
	gene deletion strategy is combinatorial and consequently the computational
	time increases exponentially with the size of the problem, and it
	is therefore interesting to develop new faster algorithms.RESULTS:In
	this study we report an evolutionary programming based method to
	rapidly identify gene deletion strategies for optimization of a desired
	phenotypic objective function. We illustrate the proposed method
	for two important design parameters in industrial fermentations,
	one linear and other non-linear, by using a genome-scale model of
	the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Potential metabolic engineering
	targets for improved production of succinic acid, glycerol and vanillin
	are identified and underlying flux changes for the predicted mutants
	are discussed.CONCLUSION:We show that evolutionary programming enables
	solving large gene knockout problems in relatively short computational
	time. The proposed algorithm also allows the optimization of non-linear
	objective functions or incorporation of non-linear constraints and
	additionally provides a family of close to optimal solutions. The
	identified metabolic engineering strategies suggest that non-intuitive
	genetic modifications span several different pathways and may be
	necessary for solving challenging metabolic engineering problems.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the hierarchical computational framework OptStrain
	aimed at guiding pathway modifications, through reaction additions
	and deletions, of microbial networks for the overproduction of targeted
	compounds. These compounds may range from electrons or hydrogen in
	biofuel cell and environmental applications to complex drug precursor
	molecules. A comprehensive database of biotransformations, referred
	to as the Universal database (with >5700 reactions), is compiled
	and regularly updated by downloading and curating reactions from
	multiple biopathway database sources. Combinatorial optimization
	is then used to elucidate the set(s) of non-native functionalities,
	extracted from this Universal database, to add to the examined production
	host for enabling the desired product formation. Subsequently, competing
	functionalities that divert flux away from the targeted product are
	identified and removed to ensure higher product yields coupled with
	growth. This work represents an advancement over earlier efforts
	by establishing an integrated computational framework capable of
	constructing stoichiometrically balanced pathways, imposing maximum
	product yield requirements, pinpointing the optimal substrate(s),
	and evaluating different microbial hosts. The range and utility of
	OptStrain are demonstrated by addressing two very different product
	molecules. The hydrogen case study pinpoints reaction elimination
	strategies for improving hydrogen yields using two different substrates
	for three separate production hosts. In contrast, the vanillin study
	primarily showcases which non-native pathways need to be added into
	\textit{Escherichia coli}. In summary, OptStrain provides a useful
	tool to aid microbial strain design and, more importantly, it establishes

	been an unprecedented increase in the use of microorganisms for the
	production of biofuels, industrial chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors.
	In this regard, biotechnologists are confronted with the challenge
	to efficiently convert biomass and other renewable resources into
	useful biochemicals. With the advent of organism-specific mathematical
	models of metabolism, scientists have used computations to identify
	genetic modifications that maximize the yield of a desired product.
	In this paper, we introduce OptForce, an algorithm that identifies
	all possible metabolic interventions that lead to the overproduction
	of a biochemical of interest. Unlike existing techniques, OptForce
	does not rely on the maximization of a fitness function to predict
	metabolic fluxes. Instead, OptForce contrasts the metabolic flux
	patterns observed in an initial strain and a strain overproducing
	the chemical at the target yield. The essence of this procedure is
	the identification of all coordinated reaction modifications that
	force the network towards the overproduction target. We used OptForce
	to predict metabolic interventions for succinate overproduction in
	<italic>\textit{Escherichia coli}</italic>. The results described
	in this paper not only uncover existing strain designs for succinate
	production but also elucidate new ones that can be experimentally

	\textit{Escherichia coli} K-12 MG1655 have been developed and used
	to study the bacterium's metabolism and phenotypic behavior. The
	most comprehensive E. coli model to date (E. coli iJE660a GSM) accounts
	for 660 genes and includes 627 unique biochemical reactions.RESULTS:An
	expanded genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli (iJR904 GSM/GPR)
	has been reconstructed which includes 904 genes and 931 unique biochemical
	reactions. The reactions in the expanded model are both elementally
	and charge balanced. Network gap analysis led to putative assignments
	for 55 open reading frames (ORFs). Gene to protein to reaction associations
	(GPR) are now directly included in the model. Comparisons between
	predictions made by iJR904 and iJE660a models show that they are
	generally similar but differ under certain circumstances. Analysis
	of genome-scale proton balancing shows how the flux of protons into

	coli iJR904 has improved capabilities over iJE660a. iJR904 is a more
	complete and chemically accurate description of E. coli metabolism

	metabolism to address industrial goals. However, the use of these
	methods has been restricted to bioinformaticians or other expert
	researchers. The main aim of this work is, therefore, to provide
	a user-friendly computational tool for Metabolic Engineering applications.RESULTS:OptFlux
	is an open-source and modular software aimed at being the reference
	computational application in the field. It is the first tool to incorporate
	strain optimization tasks, i.e., the identification of Metabolic
	Engineering targets, using Evolutionary Algorithms/Simulated Annealing
	metaheuristics or the previously proposed OptKnock algorithm. It
	also allows the use of stoichiometric metabolic models for (i) phenotype
	simulation of both wild-type and mutant organisms, using the methods
	of Flux Balance Analysis, Minimization of Metabolic Adjustment or
	Regulatory on/off Minimization of Metabolic flux changes, (ii) Metabolic
	Flux Analysis, computing the admissible flux space given a set of
	measured fluxes, and (iii) pathway analysis through the calculation
	of Elementary Flux Modes.OptFlux also contemplates several methods
	for model simplification and other pre-processing operations aimed
	at reducing the search space for optimization algorithms.The software
	supports importing/exporting to several flat file formats and it
	is compatible with the SBML standard. OptFlux has a visualization
	module that allows the analysis of the model structure that is compatible
	with the layout information of Cell Designer, allowing the superimposition
	of simulation results with the model graph.CONCLUSIONS:The OptFlux
	software is freely available, together with documentation and other
	resources, thus bridging the gap from research in strain optimization
	algorithms and the final users. It is a valuable platform for researchers
	in the field that have available a number of useful tools. Its open-source
	nature invites contributions by all those interested in making their
	methods available for the community.Given its plug-in based architecture
	it can be extended with new functionalities. Currently, several plug-ins
	are being developed, including network topology analysis tools and
	the integration with Boolean network based regulatory models.},

  abstract = {Increasing demands for petroleum have stimulated sustainable ways
	to produce chemicals and biofuels. Specifically, fatty acids of varying
	chain lengths (C(6)-C(16)) naturally synthesized in many organisms
	are promising starting points for the catalytic production of industrial
	chemicals and diesel-like biofuels. However, bio-production of fatty
	acids from plants and other microbial production hosts relies heavily
	on manipulating tightly regulated fatty acid biosynthetic pathways.
	In addition, precursors for fatty acids are used along other central
	metabolic pathways for the production of amino acids and biomass,
	which further complicates the engineering of microbial hosts for
	higher yields. Here, we demonstrate an iterative metabolic engineering
	effort that integrates computationally driven predictions and metabolic
	flux analysis techniques to meet this challenge. The OptForce procedure
	was used for suggesting and prioritizing genetic manipulations that
	overproduce fatty acids of different chain lengths from C(6) to C(16)
	starting with wild-type E. coli. We identified some common but mostly
	chain-specific genetic interventions alluding to the possibility
	of fine-tuning overproduction for specific fatty acid chain lengths.
	In accordance with the OptForce prioritization of interventions,
	fabZ and acyl-ACP thioesterase were upregulated and fadD was deleted
	to arrive at a strain that produces 1.70g/L and 0.14g fatty acid/g
	glucose ( approximately 39% maximum theoretical yield) of C(14-16)
	fatty acid in minimal M9 medium. These results highlight the benefit

	the development of integrative methods to analyze and interpret the
	systemic properties of cellular metabolism. A shift in emphasis from
	single metabolic reactions to systemically defined pathways is one
	consequence of such an integrative analysis of metabolic systems.
	The constraints of systemic stoichiometry, and limited thermodynamics
	have led to the definition of the flux space within the context of
	convex analysis. The flux space of the metabolic system, containing
	all allowable flux distributions, is constrained to a convex polyhedral
	cone in a high-dimensional space. From metabolic pathway analysis,
	the edges of the high-dimensional flux cone are vectors that correspond
	to systemically defined "extreme pathways" spanning the capabilities
	of the system. The addition of maximum flux capacities of individual
	metabolic reactions serves to further constrain the flux space and
	has led to the development of flux balance analysis using linear
	optimization to calculate optimal flux distributions. Here we provide
	the precise theoretical connections between pathway analysis and
	flux balance analysis allowing for their combined application to
	study integrated metabolic function. Shifts in metabolic behavior
	are calculated using linear optimization and are then interpreted
	using the extreme pathways to demonstrate the concept of pathway
	utilization. Changes to the reaction network, such as the removal
	of a reaction, can lead to the generation of suboptimal phenotypes
	that can be directly attributed to the loss of pathway function and
	capabilities. Optimal growth phenotypes are calculated as a function
	of environmental variables, such as the availability of substrate
	and oxygen, leading to the definition of phenotypic phase planes.
	It is illustrated how optimality properties of the computed flux
	distributions can be interpreted in terms of the extreme pathways.
	Together these developments are applied to an example network and
	to core metabolism of \textit{Escherichia coli} demonstrating the
	connections between the extreme pathways, optimal flux distributions,
	and phenotypic phase planes. The consequences of changing environmental
	and internal conditions of the network are examined for growth on
	glucose and succinate in the face of a variety of gene deletions.
	The convergence of the calculation of optimal phenotypes through
	linear programming and the definition of extreme pathways establishes
	a different perspective for the understanding of how a defined metabolic
	network is best used under different environmental and internal conditions

  abstract = {Within the last decades NMR spectroscopy has undergone tremendous
	development and has become a powerful analytical tool for the investigation
	of intracellular flux distributions in biochemical networks using
	13C-labeled substrates. Not only are the experiments much easier
	to conduct than experiments employing radioactive tracer elements,
	but NMR spectroscopy also provides additional information on the
	labeling pattern of the metabolites. Whereas the maximum amount of
	information obtainable with 14C-labeled substrates is the fractional
	enrichment in the individual carbon atom positions, NMR spectroscopy
	can also provide information on the degree of labeling at neighboring
	carbon atom positions by analyzing multiplet patterns in NMR spectra
	or using 2-dimensional NMR spectra. It is possible to quantify the
	mole fractions of molecules that show a specific labeling pattern,
	i.e., information of the isotopomer distribution in metabolite pools
	can be obtained. The isotopomer distribution is the maximum amount
	of information that in theory can be obtained from 13C-tracer studies.
	The wealth of information contained in NMR spectra frequently leads
	to overdetermined algebraic systems. Consequently, fluxes must be
	estimated by nonlinear least squares analysis, in which experimental
	labeling data is compared with simulated steady state isotopomer
	distributions. Hence, mathematical models are required to compute
	the steady state isotopomer distribution as a function of a given
	set of steady state fluxes. Because 2n possible labeling patterns
	exist in a molecule of n carbon atoms, and each pattern corresponds
	to a separate state in the isotopomer model, these models are inherently
	complex. Model complexity, so far, has restricted usage of isotopomer
	information to relatively small metabolic networks. A general methodology
	for the formulation of isotopomer models is described. The model
	complexity of isotopomer models is reduced to that of classical metabolic
	models by expressing the 2n isotopomer mass balances of a metabolite
	pool in a single matrix equation. Using this approach an isotopomer
	model has been implemented that describes label distribution in primary
	carbon metabolism, i.e., in a metabolic network including the Embdenâ€“Meyerhofâ€“Parnas
	and pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and
	selected anaplerotic reaction sequences. The model calculates the
	steady state label distribution in all metabolite pools as a function
	of the steady state fluxes and is applied to demonstrate the effect
	of selected anaplerotic fluxes on the labeling pattern of the pathway
	intermediates. Â© 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Biotechnol Bioeng55:831â€“840,

  abstract = {Predicting the metabolic state of an organism after a gene knockout
	is a challenging task, because the regulatory system governs a series
	of transient metabolic changes that converge to a steady-state condition.
	Regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM) is a constraint-based algorithm
	for predicting the metabolic steady state after gene knockouts. It
	aims to minimize the number of significant flux changes (hence on/off)
	with respect to the wild type. ROOM is shown to accurately predict
	steady-state metabolic fluxes that maintain flux linearity, in agreement
	with experimental flux measurements, and to correctly identify short
	alternative pathways used for rerouting metabolic flux in response
	to gene knockouts. ROOM's growth rate and flux predictions are compared
	with previously suggested algorithms, minimization of metabolic adjustment,
	and flux balance analysis (FBA). We find that minimization of metabolic
	adjustment provides accurate predictions for the initial transient
	growth rates observed during the early postperturbation state, whereas
	ROOM and FBA more successfully predict final higher steady-state
	growth rates. Although FBA explicitly maximizes the growth rate,
	ROOM does not, and only implicitly favors flux distributions having
	high growth rates. This indicates that, even though the cell has
	not evolved to cope with specific mutations, regulatory mechanisms
	aiming to minimize flux changes after genetic perturbations may indeed
	work to this effect. Further work is needed to identify metrics that
	characterize the complete trajectory from the initial to the final
	metabolic steady states after genetic perturbations.},

  abstract = {In metabolic systems, the cellular network of metabolic reactions
	together with constraints of
	
	(ir)reversibility of enzymes determines the space of all possible
	steady-state phenotypes. Analysis of large
	
	metabolic models, however, is not feasible in real-time and identification
	of a smaller model without loss
	
	of accuracy is desirable for model-based bioprocess optimization and
	control. To this end, we propose
	
	two search algorithms for systematic identification of a subset of
	pathways that match the observed
	
	cellular phenotype relevant for a particular process condition. Central
	carbon metabolism of {E}scherichia
	
	coli was used as a case-study together with three phenotypic datasets
	obtained from the literature. The
	
	first search method is based on ranking pathways and the second is
	a controlled random search (CRS)
	
	algorithm. Since we wish to obtain a biologically realistic subset
	of pathways, the objective function to
	
	be minimized is a trade-off between the error and investment costs.
	We found that the CRS outperforms
	
	the ranking algorithm, as it is less likely to fall into local minima.
	In addition, we compared two pathway
	
	analysis methods (elementary modes versus generating vectors) in terms
	of modelling accuracy and
	
	computational intensity. We conclude that generating vectors have
	preference over elementary modes
	
	to describe a particular phenotype. Overall, the original model containing
	433 generating vectors or 2706
	
	elementary modes could be reduced to a system of one to three pathways
	giving a good correlation with
	
	the measured datasets. We consider this work as a first step towards
	the use of detailed metabolic models
	
	to improve real-time optimization, monitoring, and control of biological
	processes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Constraint-based approaches facilitate the prediction of
	cellular metabolic capabilities, based, in turn on predictions of
	the repertoire of enzymes encoded in the genome. Recently, genome
	annotations have been used to reconstruct genome scale metabolic
	reaction networks for numerous species, including Homo sapiens, which
	allow simulations that provide valuable insights into topics, including
	predictions of gene essentiality of pathogens, interpretation of
	genetic polymorphism in metabolic disease syndromes and suggestions
	for novel approaches to microbial metabolic engineering. These constraint-based
	simulations are being integrated with the functional genomics portals,
	an activity that requires efficient implementation of the constraint-based
	simulations in the web-based environment.RESULTS:Here, we present
	Acorn, an open source (GNU GPL) grid computing system for constraint-based
	simulations of genome scale metabolic reaction networks within an
	interactive web environment. The grid-based architecture allows efficient
	execution of computationally intensive, iterative protocols such
	as Flux Variability Analysis, which can be readily scaled up as the
	numbers of models (and users) increase. The web interface uses AJAX,
	which facilitates efficient model browsing and other search functions,
	and intuitive implementation of appropriate simulation conditions.
	Research groups can install Acorn locally and create user accounts.
	Users can also import models in the familiar SBML format and link
	reaction formulas to major functional genomics portals of choice.
	Selected models and simulation results can be shared between different
	users and made publically available. Users can construct pathway
	map layouts and import them into the server using a desktop editor
	integrated within the system. Pathway maps are then used to visualise
	numerical results within the web environment. To illustrate these
	features we have deployed Acorn and created a web server allowing
	constraint based simulations of the genome scale metabolic reaction
	networks of E. coli, S. cerevisiae and M. tuberculosis.CONCLUSIONS:Acorn
	is a free software package, which can be installed by research groups
	to create a web based environment for computer simulations of genome
	scale metabolic reaction networks. It facilitates shared access to
	models and creation of publicly available constraint based modelling

	This technique has been used for finding pathways that may have been

	investigating cell metabolisms in microbial communities. In this
	review paper, we summarize the applications of 13C approaches to

	have revealed the operations of the Entnerâ€“Doudoroff pathway, the
	reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle, new enzymes for biosynthesis of
	central metabolites, diverse respiration routes in phototrophic metabolism,
	co-metabolism of carbon nutrients and novel CO2 fixation pathways.
	This review also discusses new isotopic methods to map carbon fluxes
	in global metabolisms, as well as potential factors influencing the
	metabolic flux quantification (e.g. metabolite channelling, the isotopic
	purity of 13C substrates and the isotopic effect). Although 13C labelling

	genetic diversity in a microbial population followed by screening
	for strains with improved phenotypes. One of the most common goals
	in this field is the generation of a high rate chemical producing
	strain. A major hurdle with this approach is that many chemicals
	do not have easy to recognize attributes, making their screening
	expensive and time consuming. To address this problem, it was previously
	suggested to use microbial biosensors to facilitate the detection
	and quantification of chemicals of interest. Here, we present novel
	computational methods to: (i) rationally design microbial biosensors
	for chemicals of interest based on substrate auxotrophy that would
	enable their high-throughput screening; (ii) predict engineering
	strategies for coupling the synthesis of a chemical of interest with
	the production of a proxy metabolite for which high-throughput screening
	is possible via a designed bio-sensor. The biosensor design method
	is validated based on known genetic modifications in an array of
	E. coli strains auxotrophic to various amino-acids. Predicted chemical
	production rates achievable via the biosensor-based approach are
	shown to potentially improve upon those predicted by current rational
	strain design approaches. (A Matlab implementation of the biosensor

  abstract = {Abstract: Using optimization based methods to predict fluxes in metabolic
	flux balance models has been a successful approach for some microorganisms,
	enabling construction of in silico models and even inference of some
	regulatory motifs. However, this success has not been translated
	to mammalian cells. The lack of knowledge about metabolic objectives
	in mammalian cells is a major obstacle that prevents utilization
	of various metabolic engineering tools and methods for tissue engineering
	and biomedical purposes. In this work, we investigate and identify
	possible metabolic objectives for hepatocytes cultured in vitro.
	To achieve this goal, we present a special data-mining procedure
	for identifying metabolic objective functions in mammalian cells.
	This multi-level optimization based algorithm enables identifying
	the major fluxes in the metabolic objective from MFA data in the
	absence of information about critical active constraints of the system.
	Further, once the objective is determined, active flux constraints
	can also be identified and analyzed. This information can be potentially
	used in a predictive manner to improve cell culture results or clinical
	metabolic outcomes. As a result of the application of this method,
	it was found that in vitro cultured hepatocytes maximize oxygen uptake,
	coupling of urea and TCA cycles, and synthesis of serine and urea.
	Selection of these fluxes as the metabolic objective enables accurate
	prediction of the flux distribution in the system given a limited
	amount of flux data; thus presenting a workable in silico model for
	cultured hepatocytes. It is observed that an overall homeostasis
	picture is also emergent in the findings.},

	of 5.87 mmol at ATP per g (dry weight)-h were incorporated on the
	basis of a comparison with experimental data. From computations of
	optimal growth increased oxygen limitations were found to result
	in the secretion of acetate, formate, and ethanol in that order.
	Consistent with the experimental data in the literature, by-product
	secretion rates increased linearly with the growth rate. The computed
	optimal growth under increasing oxygen limitation revealed four critical
	growth rates at which changes in the by-product secretion pattern
	were observed. Concomitant with by-product secretion under oxygen
	limitations were changes in metabolic pathway utilization. The shifts
	in metabolism were characterized by changes in the metabolic values
	(computed as shadow prices) of the various redox carriers. The redox
	potential was thus identified as a likely trigger that leads to metabolic
	shifts.2+ Äƒ},

  abstract = {The theoretical basis of a cybernetic metabolic network design and
	analysis framework, which has been subsequently successfully applied
	to predict system response to genetic alteration, is presented. This
	conceptual methodology consists of three main branches, namely, a
	model realization framework, a representation of genetic alteration,
	and lastly, a metabolic design component. These concepts are introduced
	as a series of postulates that describe the basic tenets of the approach.
	Each branch is discussed in turn, starting with the cybernetic representation
	of arbitrarily complex metabolic networks. A set of postulates is
	put forth that affords the modular construction of cybernetic models
	of metabolic networks using as a base a library of elementary pathways.
	This is followed by a discussion of the representation of genetic
	alterations within the cybernetic framework. It is postulated that
	the objective of the base network and the altered system are identical
	(at least on the time scale required for the organism to "learn"
	new objectives). This implies, with respect to resource allocation,
	that the base network and its genetically altered counterpart may
	still be treated as optimal systems; however, the set of competing
	physiological choices open to the altered network expands or contracts
	depending upon the nature of the genetic perturbation. Lastly, to
	add a predictive design aspect to the methodology, we present a set
	of postulates that outline the application of metabolic control analysis
	to cybernetic model systems. We postulate that sensitivity coefficients
	computed from a cybernetic model, although still local in scope,
	have the added benefit of a systematic representation of regulatory
	function as described by the cybernetic variables. Thus, information
	gained from sensitivity measurements stemming from a cybernetic model
	include the explicit input of metabolic regulation, a component that
	is lacking in a purely kinetic representation of metabolic function.
	The sensitivity results can then be employed to develop qualitative
	strategies for the rational alteration of metabolic function, which
	can be evaluated by simulation of an appropriately modified cybernetic
	model of the base network.},

  abstract = {Cellular life is a highly redundant complex system; yet, the evolutionary
	maintenance of the redundancy remains unexplained. Using a systems
	biology approach, we infer that 37â€“47% of metabolic reactions in
	\textit{Escherichia coli} and yeast can be individually removed without
	blocking the production of any biomass component under any nutritional
	condition. However, the majority of these redundant reactions are
	preserved because they have differential maximal efficiencies at
	different conditions or their loss causes an immediate fitness reduction
	that can only be regained via mutation, drift, and selection in evolution.
	The remaining redundancies are attributable to pleiotropic effects
	or recent horizontal gene transfers. We find that E. coli and yeast
	exhibit opposite relationships between the functional importance
	and redundancy level of a reaction, which is inconsistent with the
	conjecture that redundancies are preserved as an adaptation to back
	up important parts in the system. Interestingly, the opposite relationships
	can both be recapitulated by a simple model in which the natural
	environments of the organisms change frequently. Thus, adaptive backup
	is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the high redundancy
	of cellular metabolic networks. Taken together, our results strongly
	suggest that redundant reactions are not kept as backups and that
	the genetic robustness of metabolic networks is an evolutionary by-product.},

	this field, we now need to develop methods to incorporate additional
	"omic" data types including transcriptomics, metabolomics, and fluxomics
	to further facilitate the construction, validation, and predictive
	capabilities of these models. The work herein combines metabolic
	flux data with an in silico model of central metabolism of {E}scherichia
	coli for model centric integration of the flux data. The extreme
	pathways for this network, which define the allowable solution space
	for all possible flux distributions, are analyzed using the alpha-spectrum.
	The alpha-spectrum determines which extreme pathways can and cannot
	contribute to the metabolic flux distribution for a given condition
	and gives the allowable range of weightings on each extreme pathway
	that can contribute. Since many extreme pathways cannot be used under
	certain conditions, the result is a "condition-specific" solution
	space that is a subset of the original solution space. The alpha-spectrum
	results are used to create a "condition-specific" extreme pathway
	matrix that can be analyzed using singular value decomposition (SVD).
	The first mode of the SVD analysis characterizes the solution space
	for a given condition. We show that SVD analysis of the alpha-spectrum
	extreme pathway matrix that incorporates measured uptake and byproduct
	secretion rates, can predict internal flux trends for different experimental
	conditions. These predicted internal flux trends are, in general,
	consistent with the flux trends measured using experimental metabolic

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Quantitative knowledge of intracellular fluxes is important
	for a comprehensive characterization of metabolic networks and their
	functional operation. In contrast to direct assessment of metabolite
	concentrations, in vivo metabolite fluxes must be inferred indirectly
	from measurable quantities in 13C experiments. The required experience,
	the complicated network models, large and heterogeneous data sets,
	and the time-consuming set-up of highly controlled experimental conditions
	largely restricted metabolic flux analysis to few expert groups.
	A conceptual simplification of flux analysis is the analytical determination
	of metabolic flux ratios exclusively from MS data, which can then
	be used in a second step to estimate absolute in vivo fluxes.RESULTS:Here
	we describe the user-friendly software package FiatFlux that supports
	flux analysis for non-expert users. In the first module, ratios of
	converging fluxes are automatically calculated from GC-MS-detected
	13C-pattern in protein-bound amino acids. Predefined fragmentation
	patterns are automatically identified and appropriate statistical
	data treatment is based on the comparison of redundant information
	in the MS spectra. In the second module, absolute intracellular fluxes
	may be calculated by a 13C-constrained flux balancing procedure that
	combines experimentally determined fluxes in and out of the cell
	and the above flux ratios. The software is preconfigured to derive
	flux ratios and absolute in vivo fluxes from [1-13C] and [U-13C]glucose
	experiments and GC-MS analysis of amino acids for a variety of microorganisms.CONCLUSION:FiatFlux
	is an intuitive tool for quantitative investigations of intracellular
	metabolism by users that are not familiar with numerical methods
	or isotopic tracer experiments. The aim of this open source software
	is to enable non-specialists to adapt the software to their specific
	scientific interests, including other 13C-substrates, labeling mixtures,

	we introduce OptCom, a comprehensive flux balance analysis framework

	OptCom is general enough to capture any type of interactions (positive,
